Project Overview

Driver attrition is a critical challenge for Ola due to high churn and intense competition in the ride-hailing market. Frequent driver exits increase acquisition costs, disrupt service stability, and negatively impact organizational morale.

This project, developed as part of Ola’s Analytics function, focuses on predicting driver attrition using historical data from 2019–2020. The objective is to identify drivers at risk of leaving the platform and enable data-driven retention strategies.
